    <p class="justify">
      Global Fishing Watch analyzes Automatic Identification System (AIS) data
      collected from vessels that our research has identified as known or
      possible commercial fishing vessels, and applies a fishing detection
      algorithm to determine “apparent fishing activity” based on changes in
      vessel speed and direction. As AIS data varies in completeness, accuracy
      and quality, it is possible that some fishing activity is not identified
      as such by Global Fishing Watch; conversely, Global Fishing Watch may
      show apparent fishing activity where fishing is not actually taking
      place. For these reasons, Global Fishing Watch qualifies all designations
      of vessel fishing activity, including synonyms of the term “fishing
      activity,” such as “fishing” or “fishing effort,” as “apparent,” rather
      than certain. Any/all Global Fishing Watch information about “apparent
      fishing activity” should be considered an estimate and must be relied
      upon solely at your own risk.
